            <h2>Rex's Story</h2>
            <p>In the bustling toy box of Andy's room, Rex, the lovable but
                nervous Tyrannosaurus rex toy, navigated a world filled with
                towering challenges and tiny triumphs. With a roar that often
                sounded more like a squeak and a heart as big as his fears, Rex
                faced each day with a mixture of trepidation and determination.
                From epic battles against imaginary foes to heartwarming tea parties
                with his fellow toys, Rex embraced every moment with a mixture of bravery
                and uncertainty. Despite his occasional stumbles and setbacks, Rex's
                unwavering loyalty and kind heart endeared him to his friends, who stood
                by his side through every roar and rumble. And as the sun dipped below the
                horizon, casting long shadows across the room, Rex found comfort in the knowledge
                that no matter how big or scary the world may seem, he was never alone,
                surrounded by friends who loved him just the way he was.</p>
