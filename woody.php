            <h2>Woody's Story</h2>
            <p>In the bustling playroom of a young boy named Andy, Woody,
                the stalwart cowboy doll, embodied the essence of loyalty
                and leadership among the toys. From the earliest days, Woody
                stood tall as Andy's favorite, his worn-out hat and weathered
                boots bearing witness to countless adventures. With a heart as
                big as the Wild West horizon, Woody's days were a tapestry of joyous
                playtimes and comforting embraces, his steadfast presence reassuring his
                toy comrades through every stormy night and sunny day. Though Andy grew
                older, and new toys arrived with each passing birthday, Woody remained a
                beacon of unwavering friendship, his bond with Andy transcending time and
                space, forever etched in the fabric of their shared memories.</p>
